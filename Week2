1. 
//multiply = function (a, b) {
  return a * b;
  
  
  
2.You'll be given a string, and have to return the sum of all characters as an int. 
The function should be able to handle all ASCII characters.

examples:

uniTotal("a") == 97 uniTotal("aaa") == 291
//function uniTotal(str) {
  var count = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    count += str.charCodeAt(i);
  }
  return count;
}

3.
Write a function get_char() / getChar() which takes a number
 and returns the corresponding ASCII char for that value.
 //const getChar = String.fromCharCode;
 
 4.Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.

Examples:(Input1, Input2 --> Output (explanation)))
 
 //function addBinary(a,b){
  return (a+b).toString(2)
}



5.Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases
//function finalGrade (exam, projects) {
  if(exam > 90 || projects > 10) return 100;
  if(exam > 75 & projects >= 5) return 90;
  if(exam > 50 & projects >= 2) return 75;
  return 0;
}
